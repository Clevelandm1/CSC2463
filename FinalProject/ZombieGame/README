In zombie game, you are a zombie who must eat humans as fast as possible.
You chase humans down on a movable map with a camera that follows the zombie.
The zombie must touch the humans to eat them and increase its score. There are
two types of humans: small ones that are slower but worth one point, and
                      large ones that are faster but worth two points.
Whenever you eat a small human, the light flashes red and slowly fades out.
Whenever you eat a large human, the light flashes green, then fades into yellow, 
then fades into red, and then fades out. The small and large humans also have 
different eating sounds.


This game is controlled by one joystick, and it outputs to one RGB LED.
